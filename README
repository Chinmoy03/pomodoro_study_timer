Principle behind the code:
The idea of the Pomodoro timer is that you work for 25 minutes and then get a 5 minute break. After the 4th 25 minute work time, you get a long break of 20 minutes.

Note: If you are creating an executable file or are generally runnning the program, always make sure that the png file of
tomato is in the same directory as the code file or executable file, or the program will not run successfully.
